APPENDIX XVII

1116 Nava oouuucrrou

Wrru Ep. 1583 begins a series oi 43 autograph lettere from
Erasmus to his Antwerp banher, Erasmus Sobata, which com·

plement, though not without gape the series oi Sohete’ lettere now
at Basle (Ep. 1541 etc). They orm the major part ol a collection
oi lettere, 51 in all, which once belonged to hlgr. P. F. X. de Ram,
Reotor magnificus ol leuvam Univereity († 14 May 1865). The

remaining eight are :—

Ep. 1300. 1. ErasmuatoJ. Vendat Noot. S. P. Vir... 14 July 1522, Baelo.
Ep 1589. 2 Pighiustolouvain Theol²¹. venerabiles. . . 12 July 1525, Rome.

8. ObapuystoE. Sobata Pie . .. 138661153616118611.

Oi these No. 1 16611 original letter, written by a secretary and
eigned by Erasmus: Noe. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 are autograph throughout:
Nos. 4, 6 616 contemporary copies. Erasmus' letters to the two
Sabate, 161161 and eon, had no doubt been preserved by the reci-
1116.11,11161“1.1111111116111111
hands, communicated by Gilles, who wae hie follow-towneman, in
discharge of the business which it contained. The four remaining,
Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, had perhaps been gethered together by hlgr. de Ram.

Side by eide with the original autographa ie a 661 61 copiae made
by 6 1161 very competent xix⁰. hand, with some annotatione and
corrections by hlgr. de Ram; which probably represent. the first
steps taken by him towards publication. Iu three 66666 these are
the only traces iu the collection, of three of Erasmue' autograph
letters to Schete; for with ready generosity the Rootor had pre-
sented the originale of these three to monde—one to Mgr. Angelini
in Rome, and two othere to Baron Stassart and Moneieur Quetelet‚
who in 1842 were Director and Secretary of 116 Brueeele Academy.
The first of these autographe wae etill 61 Rome in 1909, in the
661166116661061.Α11611111,6161111111)1 allowed 1116 to examine it.
The second (Ep. 1781) ie in the Staesart collection at the Brueeele
Academy: the third I have not been able to trace.

The earliest record of the Neve collection that I 6611 find is in
1842. In that year hlgr. de Ram contributed an article, Particu-
1611116 eur lc aejoar d’llraama d Belo, to the Ballelias of the Academia
royale dee ecienoee et belles-lettres de Bruxelles¹; in which he
printed Nos. 7, 8, with the statement that the autograph originale
